#Pharis Fellowship URD Research Poster

This is a research poster I presented as part of the Undergraduate Research Day hosted at the University of Houston. The primary goal of my research was to discover whether a correlation existed between patients who died within 30 days of their C.difficile Infection diagnosis and other combinations of attributes/pathways they possessed.
